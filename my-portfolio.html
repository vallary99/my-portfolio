        <p> 
            <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
            I'm a 20-year old born and raised in the lake basin,Kisumu to be specific.
            As a first-born child( which nobody ever believes I am ) and daughter my parents have 
            always been very watchful 
            and protective.
            They say I have to be a good role model to my siblings.So far I think I have 
            lived to their expectations.
            Both my parents are teachers so education is highly prioritized.
            I could say I have been to among the best performing schools in the country
            and for that I really owe my parents.
            Computers have always facinated me and as i grew up i developed an intrest 
            in technology especially the software part.
            As i continue with my computer science journey i'm planning to also study 
            Artificial Intelligence and Computer security.
            It has always been my dream to work with safaricom and microsoft.I decided to join moringa 
            School because it could be my stepping stone to achieve my dreams of being a good software 
            developer.
                
        </p>
            <h2>INTERESTS</h2>
            I like watching movies,playing games,chess and poker.I'm also a swimmer even 
            though i fear cold water.
            I can play tennis both table and lawn.I love sleep!When I'm streesed I sleep on my 
            my problems and wake up with my solution most of the time.I also workout 
            to ease tension or sometimes to pass time.Those who dont me think I'm an introvet which 
            isn't true though I have very few friends coz i have trust issues.
