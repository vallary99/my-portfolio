                <strong>BACKGROUND</strong><br><br>
                I'm a 20-year old born and raised in the lake basin,Kisumu to be specific.
                As a first-born child( which nobody ever believes I am ) and daughter my parents have 
                always been very watchful 
                and protective.
                They say I have to be a good role model to my siblings.So far I think I have 
                lived to their expectations.
                Both my parents are teachers so education is highly prioritized.
                I could say I have been to among the best performing schools in the country
                and for that I really owe my parents.
                Computers have always facinated me and as i grew up i developed an intrest 
                in technology especially the software part.
                As i continue with my computer science journey i'm planning to also study 
                Artificial Intelligence and Computer security.
                It has always been my dream to work with safaricom and microsoft.I decided to join moringa 
                School because it could be my stepping stone to achieve my dreams of being a good software 
                developer.

                <strong>INTERESTS</strong><br><br>
                I like watching movies,playing games,chess and poker.I'm also a swimmer even 
                though i fear cold water.
                I can play tennis both table and lawn.I love sleep!When I'm streesed I sleep on my 
                my problems and wake up with my solution most of the time.I also workout 
                to ease tension or sometimes to pass time.Those who dont me think I'm an introvet which 
                isn't true though I have very few friends coz i have trust issues.
